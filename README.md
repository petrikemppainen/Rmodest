###Installing

With **devtools** (accessible from CRAN) **MODEST** can be installed by:
```r
devtools::install_github("petrikemppainen/MODEST")
```
This downloads the source directly from **github** and builds the vignettes and thus requires LaTeX to be installed on your computer.

Alternatively, download the source file directly and install by:
```r
install.packages("/path_to/source_file", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```
Please install and follow package documentation for more information.
